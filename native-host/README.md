# Native host

The host is started by Edge/Chrome through native messaging and stays alive as
long as the extension port is open.

## Two channels

```
Edge extension  <-- native messaging (stdin/stdout) -->  this host
MCP server      <-- loopback TCP + token ------------>  this host
```

Native messaging can only be initiated by the extension, so the MCP server
cannot talk to the browser directly. The host bridges the two: it accepts
line-delimited JSON on `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` and forwards each request to the
extension.

## Files at runtime

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\scholar-search\bridge.json` | `{port, token, pid, started}` for the MCP server |
| stderr | diagnostics only; stdout carries protocol frames exclusively |

`bridge.json` is written on start and removed on exit. A stale file means the
host died without cleanup; the adapter surfaces the connection error instead of
retrying forever.

## Install

```powershell
# 1. load extension/ as an unpacked extension in edge://extensions
# 2. copy the extension id it shows
.\install.ps1 -ExtensionId <id>
```

The script writes `run-host.cmd`, `com.scholar.search.json`, and the registry
key under both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. Use `-Uninstall` to remove.

## Security boundary

- verbs are limited to the nine in `adapters/bridge/policy.py`;
- `goto` is https-only and restricted to the CNKI host allowlist;
- unknown parameters and oversized frames are rejected before reaching the page;
- the TCP port binds to loopback only and every request must carry the token
  generated for that process.
